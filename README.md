# Meta-analysis-R-codes
This repository contains codes that can be easily adopted on different meta-analyses. 
* WLS power: R code for calculating a priori and post hoc power for fixed- and mixed-effects meta-regression for moderators in meta-analysis. 
* resWLS: R code that contains the function for calculating and organizing WLS meta-regression results (based on metafor package) into table format (making it easier to export into csv or excel files).
* resGroup: R code that contains the function for calculating and organizing sub-group moderator analyses results (based on metafor package) into table format. 
* CorrMatrix: R code that contains the function for organizing Pearson correlation results (based on the corr.test function in Psych package) into APA-format matrix.
* MetaCalculation (v1.0): R code that contains the function for (1) doing sample-size weighted meta-analysis based on the metafor package, (2) calculating the 95%CI for tau2, and (3) organizing all meta-analytic results into table format.
* SubGroup power_post: R code for calculating post hoc power for fixed- and mixed-effects sub-group analyses for moderator in meta-analysis.
* SubGroup power_prior: R code for calculating a priori power for fixed- and mixed-effects subgroup analyses for moderator in meta-analysis.
